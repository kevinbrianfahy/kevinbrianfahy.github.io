                  <p>Thanks for checking out my portfolio website! I built this website on my own as a student of the <a href='http://ywebca.org/' target='_blank'>YWEB Career Academy</a>, which provides instruction in front end web development, comprising HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, Jquery, and project management.</p>
                  <p>I'm the type of person who always wants to know exactly how things work. As a matter of fact, one of my passions in relation to tech, is the study of the history of commerce. It's not enough for me to be involved, and to know how things work, I also like to know how we got to where we are. I consider it a well-rounded approach, albeit a time-consuming approach! </p>
                  <p>I can't say where this road will lead, who will hire me, what I'll do exactly, but I know I can be an asset, and it will be exciting. With the objective of a better user experience, and good communication with my team, I plan on helping your company achieve it's dream, as I achieve mine.</p>
                  <p>Enjoy the video above to get to know me a little more personally, or just skip right to the links at the top of the page to get right to the nitty gritty! Let's meet in person. I have an email form on my contact page for your convenience in contacting me right now!</p>
