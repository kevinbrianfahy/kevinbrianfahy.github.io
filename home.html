                <p>Thanks for checking out my portfolio website! My background is in sales and retail. In fact I was a bank manager.
                  In the end I couldn't deny my passion, as I desperately wanted to be involved in the tech world. Attending the YWEB
                  Career Academy has been a blessing for me, as I have now been able to learn the basics of Front End Web Development,
                  including JavaScript! Learning a real program language was a must for me personally, as I'm the type of person who
                  always wants to know exactly how things work.</p>
                <p>As a matter of fact, one of my passions in relation to tech is the study of the history of commerce. It's not enough
                    for me to be involved, and to know how things work, I also like to know how we got to where we are. I consider it a well-rounded
                    approach, albeit a time-consuming approach! </p>
                <p>I can't say where this road will lead, who will hire me, what I'll do exactly, but I know I can be an asset, and it
                     will be exciting. With the objective of a better user experience, and good communication with my team, I plan on
                     helping your company achieve it's dream, as I achieve mine.</p>
                <p>Enjoy the video above to get to know me a little more personally, or just skip right to the links at the top of the page
                  to get right to the nitty gritty! Let's meet in person. I have an email form on my contact page for your convenience in contacting me right now!</p>
