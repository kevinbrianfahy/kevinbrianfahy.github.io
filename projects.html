                      <h3>HTML Semantics</h3>
                      <p>Can you believe that our class started out learning JavaScript before HTML or CSS? Cool fact. The instructors
                         felt it better to dive in the deep end right away and that way it would get easier as we went along.
                         Having JavaScript knowledge first certainly made it easier to understand the importance of semantic html.
                         We learned the basics of div's - how you have parents and children, how width and height are defaulted to auto.
                         Here we learned what the DOM tree was, and how to read the html outline in the DOM. Similar to learning proper
                         structure when writing a paper, the fundamentals of properly organized html are our basis for creating a dynamic
                         website. We could see how important this is for working in a company team, where others should be able to simply
                        take a look at your DOM outline and understand how you might want the CSS and JavaScript to be written.</p>

                      <h3>CSS Zen Garden</h3>
                      <p>This was a fun project where the html was already done and we simply had to practice our beginners knowledge of
                           css selectors to design the html page.</p>

                  <div class = "selectors">
                      <h3>CSS Selectors</h3>
                      <p>Our CSS moved out of the rookie phase during this project. Challenging, yet rewarding, this project was probably the most fun for me.
                           Using nth child selectors as well as some attributes, I incorporated a triple linear gradient rotated 45 degrees
                          to attain the effect of slicing through an individual cell and creating a pyramid. VERY satisfying.</p>

                      <h3>JavaScript</h3>
                      <p>Take a look at those JavaScript worksheets I mentioned! You'll also see that we learned some command line essentials, as well as Markdown.</p>
